      "A person's creative work is nothing but a slow trek to rediscover those two or three images in whose presence his heart first opened.",
      "In writing, habit seems to be a much stronger force than either willpower or inspiration.",
      "I feel that art has something to do with an arrest of attention in the midst of distraction.",
      "After reading eighteen pages of Kafka I was possessed by such a creative fervor that I threw down the book, picked up a pen, and wrote.",
      "The solitude of writing is also quite frightening. It's quite close to madness, one just disappears for a day and loses touch.",
      "Writers all devise ways to approach that place where they expect to make the contact, where they become the conduit.",
      "I spend the first three months reading a section over and over again in English until I have it memorized.",
      "I write two pages. And then I read and read and read.",
      "I would like to see myself as belonging to writers who cut themselves off from society and shut themselves up in their rooms with their books — this is the starting point of true literature.",
      "There is only one way to read, which is to browse in libraries and bookshops, picking up books that attract you, reading only those, dropping them when they bore you.",
      "Writing for me is like travelling. I put a piece of paper on the table and then I travel. Literally.",
      "Writing was the only thing where I could be myself.",
      "Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life.",
      "A computer would slow me down, because when I use one, I cannot control myself. I always go online.",
      "A writer can read too much and be paralyzed. Or don't read, don't think, just write — and the result could be a mountain of drivel.",
      "Once you get started you have to write every day, otherwise you lose the momentum. I can only write for a few hours at a time, after that my attention fades.",
      "I would ruthlessly clear my diary and go on what we called a Crash. I would do nothing but write from 9am to 10.30pm. My fictional world was more real to me than the actual one.",
      "For every single written page, it is always one thousand pages which should be read.",
      "When I write, critics are behind me. No critic, no opinion — only images, rhythm, feeling.",
      "I love being able to go to my desk in the morning and write until I get a headache.",
      "I'm hiding very well. I feel inner peace is very important for you to write on. That's my very important task at this moment.",
